        As temperatures plummeted in the Midwest this week, the Chicago Bean once again claimed dozens of victims, frozen by the tongue to the iconic sculpture.

        "We've already seen almost 50 incidents of bean-licking," said John Waters, a representative from the Chicago Department of Public Health. "It breaks my heart to see one of Chicago's jewels treated like a dollar-store flagpole."

        No one knows exactly what draws people to lick the Bean. Risk factors may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Being triple-dog dared.</li>
        <li>Wanting to see what type of bean it tastes like. Fava? Pinto?</li>
        <li>Recent divorce.</li>
      </ul>
       <p>
        Reporters on site have tried to get to the bottom of this phenomenon. When asked what inspired her to lick the Bean, Madison Clark, a tourist visiting from upstate New York who is currenlty stuck to the Bean, simply said, "mhhhmmm!"
